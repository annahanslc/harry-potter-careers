# Streamlit App Project

My project uses streamlit to deploy an application that taps OpenAI's gpt-4.1-nano and gpt-image-1 models to give users recommendations for a career based on the magical world of Harry Potter.

The application is written in python and consists of 3 files:
  1. hp_bot.py --> contains the HPBot class
  2. hp_app.py --> the main application file
  3. requirements.txt --> contains the environment requirements for streamlit to reference

# Streamlit
